# Test Suite - Relayer
Part of development tools aka "simple scripts to listen events and trigger actions"

## How to run?

First of all the requirements are to have installed configured `solana-cli` and `axelard`. Where for Axelar part you have to provide public address of payer account in `axelard` keyring and for Solana it would be path to the payer keypair generated by `solana-cli`. All accounts must have funds otherwise operation won't success. 

```bash
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run -- --axelar-payer "axelar19h4e6wfmp94zu0w6dxst95j06dkhhanmcdsh8x" --solana-payer-path "~/.config/solana/id.json" --rpc-addr "http://devnet.rpc.axelar.dev:26657" --fees "0.050uwasm" --fees-ratio "1.4"
```
